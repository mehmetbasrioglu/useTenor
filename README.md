## 1. Installation
**useTenor** can be easily installed via NPM: `npm install useTenor`.

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP from here and require it in your project.

## 2. Usage & Guides
Attribution: First thing's first, I want to get something out of the way, attribution. To comply with Tenor's own policies, any content pulled from Tenor and published via this library has to be labeled in any one of these ways:
</br>
</br>
Powered By Tenor - used the GIF browse experience
</br>
Search Tenor - to be used as the placeholder text in the search bar


Alright, now that that's out of the way, let's take a look at some code.
  
### Define a useTenor Hook


if you want a search keyword, you can add like the code on bottom side.

or you can define a useState hook, if search keyword is null, Trends are automatically listed.

## 3. Developer Note
This library is the product of sheer boredom and curiosity, it is released as-is without any guarantees of any kind on my part. I am not responsible for what anyone does with it.
If you've made something cool using useTenor, then feel free to get in touch and I'll include a type of "Integrations" section in this README to give it a spotlight and highlight it to everyone.
